# Andyweb Testing the Zurb Foundation Framework
As I always try and keep up with what is happening in the beutiful world of front-end development I set out
to learn as much I could about the Founadtion framework which has been getting much praise as of late. These are the results of my endevours.

## Installation

If you would like to use the app as it is just clone this to your own machine, put it on your localhost or remote server and watch it fly.

## Usage

The usage of this application is questionable, I doubt that it should even be called an app; it's just me goofing around and testing stuff.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
